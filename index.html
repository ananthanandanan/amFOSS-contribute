                <h3>The Spark</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The club’s story starts when its founder, Mr. Vipin Pavithran, joined Amrita University in 2006
                    after ten years of experience with the software industry in the US.
                    The readiness to guide and mentor was the spark. His willingness to help and bring out the best in
                    each student who he mentored,
                    provided the fundamentals of what the club is established on.
                    He believes that each student has great potential which is to be brought out, which is now delivered
                    through the club activities.

                    “I know the value of right guidance at the right time and how it can make a huge impact.
                    This made me want to help any one who needed guidance.”
                </p>


                <h3>A Humble Beginning</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the summer of 2006, he was approached by Abhilash T G, seeking a mentor to participate in the IBM
                    Great Mind Challenge 2006. Soon a team of enthusiasts was formed and rigorous preparation had been
                    initiated. Initially the students were not confident of getting selected, let alone winning; however
                    they were highly motivated and enthusiastic about it. At the same time, Vipin sir was confident in
                    his students as he was certain that his students would come on top.

                    Months passed, with the team working day and night under intense preparation focusing only on their
                    goal. They missed out on their usual college life, and were often mocked by their classmates.
                    Infact, there were instances when nothing went their way and they thought of giving up, but they
                    were motivated and pushed forward by Vipin sir.

                    In the end, they ended up among the Top 5 teams from India, and were invited to Mumbai for the prize
                    distribution ceremony. This was the first national level prize to be won by Amritapuri students.

                <h3>Winning the Sun Code for Freedom</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Motivated by the success, Vipin sir started searching for more contests at the national and
                    international level. He then came across the Sun Code For Freedom 2008, conducted by Sun
                    Microsystems, which was about contributing to their open source projects. It had already been 2
                    months since the contest started and Avinash Joshi, a third-year student was put on to work on
                    contributing to Open Solaris, the open sourced version of Solaris operating system from Sun
                    Microsystems. Avinash who had just completed his course on Operating System was now expected to
                    contribute to one with over 9 million lines of code. After two months of intense effort Avinash
                    finally figured out how to contribute and started contributing to it. He documented the entire
                    process so that his peers could also get started with it and soon enough many students started
                    contributing to it.

                    Every day, students would stayback in the lab till late and work on contributing to various open
                    source software from Sun Microsystems. When the contest was judged, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
                    emerged as the champion university, with a total of 105 contributions. The team that came second had
                    only 10 contributions in total. Our students were invited to Hyderabad for the Sun Tech Days 2008
                    where the prizes were awarded. After this students started regularly contributing to Sun Open Source
                    products with the active support of Sun Microsystems.

                <h3>Gaining Recognition through GSoC</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    In 2010, Vipin sir chanced upon Google Summer of Code, and 3 members of the club got selected for
                    the first time. Over the years, through the experiences shared by the seniors, more and more
                    students started participating in GSoC. Having started with a strength of 10 members, the club now
                    has about 50 active members, and several alumni actively mentoring the club.
