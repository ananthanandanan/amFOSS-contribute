                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    FOSS@Amrita (also known as amFOSS) is a student community-based in Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,
                    Amritapuri focused on contributing to Free and Open Source Software and mentoring students to
                    achieve excellence in various fields of Computer Science.

                    We envision students to excel and become the leaders of tomorrow by imbibing valuable skills
                    relevant in the 21st century which include technical but also creative and intrapersonal skills
                    enabling students to collaborate, exchange ideas, work together and solve real-life problems.

                    Founded in 2006 by Vipin Pavithran, the mentor, the club over the years, has been one of the leading
                    student clubs in India, with over 70 active members. Students from amFOSS participate in many
                    international student open-source programs like the Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, Season of KDE,
                    Rails Girls Summer of Code and so on, each year. The club is run by the students themselves, under
                    the guidance of Vipin Pavithran with the help of the club alumni and supporting faculty.

                </p>



                <h3>What we do</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The club operates on the primary principle of mentorship where the senior members of the club
                    individually mentor juniors and the club as such acts as a community where each one helps the other
                    one out.

                    The students contribute to open-source projects of various popular open-source organizations, work
                    on developing projects aimed at solving real-world problems, participate in open-source student
                    programs, attend national and international developer meets, conferences, hackathons and so on. The
                    students also conduct workshops and technical events to encourage others to learn and contribute to
                    open-source.

                    The club believes in the holistic development of students and besides seeking excellence in
                    technical skills also engage in giving talks, conducting debates, taking part in sports and cultural
                    activities including yoga sessions, and so on.
                </p>

                <h3>What we have achieved</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The club has become one of the forerunners in contributing to open-source in the country,
                    introducing over a hundred enthusiasts every year to the world of Open-source through the club's
                    various activities.

                    Over the years, over 50 students from amFOSS have been a part of the Google Summer of Code program
                    as participating students and many have participated in the program as mentors, as well, pushing
                    Amrita Viswa Vidyapeetham to 7th in the world in global rankings of universities published by
                    Google. Over 12 students from the club have also been participating in the Google Code-In program as
                    mentors and organisation administrators.

                    Majority of the club alumni have been placed in core computer science companies such as Google,
                    Microsoft, Intel, IBM and VMWare. Members have been getting selected for summer schools at global
                    universities and paid internships at top companies including the Ben Gurion University of the Negev,
                    National Ilan University, University of Tel Aviv, National University of Singapore. Some of our
                    alumni are also currently PhD research scholars at various foreign universities including the
                    Singapore University of Technology and Design, Arizona State University and so on.

                <h3>The Spark</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The club’s story starts when its founder, Mr. Vipin Pavithran, joined Amrita University in 2006
                    after ten years of experience with the software industry in the US.
                    The readiness to guide and mentor was the spark. His willingness to help and bring out the best in
                    each student who he mentored,
                    provided the fundamentals of what the club is established on.
                    He believes that each student has great potential which is to be brought out, which is now delivered
                    through the club activities.

                    “I know the value of right guidance at the right time and how it can make a huge impact.
                    This made me want to help any one who needed guidance.”
                </p>


                <h3>A Humble Beginning</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the summer of 2006, he was approached by Abhilash T G, seeking a mentor to participate in the IBM
                    Great Mind Challenge 2006. Soon a team of enthusiasts was formed and rigorous preparation had been
                    initiated. Initially the students were not confident of getting selected, let alone winning; however
                    they were highly motivated and enthusiastic about it. At the same time, Vipin sir was confident in
                    his students as he was certain that his students would come on top.

                    Months passed, with the team working day and night under intense preparation focusing only on their
                    goal. They missed out on their usual college life, and were often mocked by their classmates.
                    Infact, there were instances when nothing went their way and they thought of giving up, but they
                    were motivated and pushed forward by Vipin sir.

                    In the end, they ended up among the Top 5 teams from India, and were invited to Mumbai for the prize
                    distribution ceremony. This was the first national level prize to be won by Amritapuri students.
                </p>

                <h3>Winning the Sun Code for Freedom</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Motivated by the success, Vipin sir started searching for more contests at the national and
                    international level. He then came across the Sun Code For Freedom 2008, conducted by Sun
                    Microsystems, which was about contributing to their open source projects. It had already been 2
                    months since the contest started and Avinash Joshi, a third-year student was put on to work on
                    contributing to Open Solaris, the open sourced version of Solaris operating system from Sun
                    Microsystems. Avinash who had just completed his course on Operating System was now expected to
                    contribute to one with over 9 million lines of code. After two months of intense effort Avinash
                    finally figured out how to contribute and started contributing to it. He documented the entire
                    process so that his peers could also get started with it and soon enough many students started
                    contributing to it.

                    Every day, students would stayback in the lab till late and work on contributing to various open
                    source software from Sun Microsystems. When the contest was judged, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
                    emerged as the champion university, with a total of 105 contributions. The team that came second had
                    only 10 contributions in total. Our students were invited to Hyderabad for the Sun Tech Days 2008
                    where the prizes were awarded. After this students started regularly contributing to Sun Open Source
                    products with the active support of Sun Microsystems.

                <h3>Gaining Recognition through GSoC</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    In 2010, Vipin sir chanced upon Google Summer of Code, and 3 members of the club got selected for
                    the first time. Over the years, through the experiences shared by the seniors, more and more
                    students started participating in GSoC. Having started with a strength of 10 members, the club now
                    has about 50 active members, and several alumni actively mentoring the club.
