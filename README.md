## Add your Lang!

Basically what you guys have to do is, choose any part of the content in the page and change it 
to your native language. After you have changed it create a readme file with your githubhandle or username in the **translation** folder. After that you can send a PR.

A demo file is already uploaded in translation folder.

Happy Coding!
